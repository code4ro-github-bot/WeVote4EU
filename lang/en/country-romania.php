Where do I vote?
You are assigned a polling station based on where they live. Electoral lists for each station are drafted ahead of election day. However, it is possible to vote at another polling station if you are away from your place of residence on election day. In this case, the chair of the polling station bureau has to register you on the supplementary electoral lists.</p>
<p>You have the possibility to get assistance in voting at the polling station or opt for voting via the mobile ballot box. Find out how and when to request the mobile ballot box on the Permanent Electoral Authority website (in Romanian).</p>
<p>Additional info for EU citizen voting in Romanian EU elections: You can vote if you are from another EU country, but you must first register on a special electoral list with the city hall of your place of residence. You can vote at the local polling station assigned to you based on your place of residence. There is also the possibility to vote at another polling station, if you are away from your place of residence on election day, but only if the county electoral bureau or the sector electoral bureau (for Bucharest) confirms that you have been included on the special electoral lists upon the phone request of the chair of the polling station electoral bureau. If you are a voter with reduced mobility, you can also vote at a different polling station than the one you are assigned to, from the same administrative-territorial unit.</p>
